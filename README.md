# c_plus_plus_integrations


I tried to use the monte carlo integration as a process to evalute the integral of sin(x), cos(x) and pow(x,2) between a and b.


the program takes as input the values a and b and return an estimation of the sine, cosine and pow(x,2) functions using uniform random distribution.
